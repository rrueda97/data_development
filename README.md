Scripts for Data Collection, Annotation and Processing

## Notes:
as you sort through data make note of things that call your attention that could be useful and suggest meta data thatcould be collected

### real_w_tensors_2500/Falling_all/
* Allistair's videos seem to be "faster" which imply they were captured at a slower frame rate. Could we use DSP to      interpolate?
* Some videos might not generate full joint mappings because certain bodyparts get occluded
* Meta Data Suggestions:
    * % of joints generated per frame 

### real_w_tensors_2500/Rolling_Bed_all/
* Simillar case with Alistair's videos on Falling_all folder
*
