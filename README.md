Scripts for Data Collection, Annotation and Processing

## Notes:
as you sort through data make note of things that call your attention that could be useful and suggest meta data thatcould be collected

### real_w_tensors_2500/Falling_all/
* Allistair's videos seem to be "faster" which imply they were captured at a slower frame rate. Could we use DSP to      interpolate?
* Some videos might not generate full joint mappings because certain bodyparts get occluded
* Meta Data Suggestions:
    * % of joints generated per frame 
* Some of the videos are not sorted properly (Alistair's files were in Alex's file)
   * Current data cleaner code requires it to be inside the same folder it's processing, not necessarily the whole thing.
